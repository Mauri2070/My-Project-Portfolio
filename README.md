# My Project Portfolio

My name is Georg Henning. I completed my Master of Science in Informatics at the Technical University of Munich (TUM) in 2025, and I enjoy developing and playing video games.

This repository contains an overview and descriptions of my projects, focusing on the games I developed.

* Game projects are described in [MyGameProjects.md](MyGameProjects.md)
* Other private Unity non-game projects are described in [OtherUnityProjects.md](OtherUnityProjects.md)
* My university non-game projects are described in [MyUniversityProjects.md](MyUniversityProjects.md)

The PDF files mentioned in the texts can be found in the release section of this repository.
