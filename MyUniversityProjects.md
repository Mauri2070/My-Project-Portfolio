# My University Projects

## Game Projects

All my game projects completed for university can be found in [My Game Projects](MyGameProjects.md). They include:

* Pick2Program (Bachelor’s practical course)
* QUAD (Bachelor’s Thesis)
* Color Jump 3D (Introduction to Informatics for Games Engineering)
* Blub’s Adventure (Interdisciplinary project, educational psychology)
* Robody at the hospital (Master’s Thesis)
* Bonus program for nurses (Master’s Thesis)
* ArthroTour (Master’s Thesis)

## Seminar Papers

### Augmented Reality Applications in Education (German)

In my bachelor's seminar, “Digital University: Current Trends and Challenges,” I wrote a paper about augmented reality (AR) applications specially designed for education and the potential of other applications in that area. The paper can be found in the PDF “Augmented Reality Anwendungen im Bildungsbereich”. Please note that the paper is written in German.

### Comparison of Single Machine Out-of-Core Graph Processing Engines

In my Master's seminar “Large-Scale Graph Processing and Graph Partitioning,” I compared different single-machine out-of-core graph processing engines based on their functionality and reported performance. The paper can be found in the PDF “Comparison of Single Machine Out-of-Core Graph Processing Engines”.

## Other Projects

### Voxel Carving for 3D Human Reconstruction

For the lecture “3D Scanning and Motion Capture,” I worked on a voxel carving implementation for 3D human reconstruction, along with three others. I was responsible for reimplementing the marching cubes algorithms for our project’s purposes and implementing a benchmarking functionality. The project was written in C++.

The project’s repository is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Mauri2070/AR_Voxel_Project) and includes the final report.
