# Other Unity Projects

The following describes private projects where I used Unity as a UI framework. All tools are developed for PC.

## Digital photo album
The name says it all. It displays photos categorized into different folders and lets users interactively view them.

## Game asset manager
Keeping an overview of game development assets bought from several stores can be challenging. Therefore, I programmed this asset manager tool. The tool provides options to add asset packs and save additional information like tags, save location, and example images. That information is directly stored in the asset pack folders to make it portable. All settings can be viewed and edited in the tool, and the save location can be opened in the system explorer.

## Vocabulary trainer
I programmed this tool to train vocabulary for my Italian language course. It provides support for different vocabulary sets. Each set consists of a list of vocabulary that can be extended at any time. A single vocabulary entry consists of the meaning in two languages, additional forms, expressions, and notes that can be edited. Further, the tool features an exercise mode where a skill level for each word is maintained. This skill level influences the frequency a word is shown in exercise mode.
