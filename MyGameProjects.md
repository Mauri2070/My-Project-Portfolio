# My Game Projects

## University Projects
This section describes the games I made during my informatics studies at the Technical University of Munich (TUM).

### Pick2Program
In my bachelor's degree, I participated in the practical course “IT-based learning,” where I developed the Serious Game “Pick2Program” with three others. The game is an Android app aimed to teach children the basics of computational thinking. Players must find their way through increasingly complex mazes by writing short programs using an intuitive symbol language. The programs are input by taking photos of the symbols. 

My tasks in the development of “Pick2Program” were:
-	Development of the symbol language
-	Implementation of the parser that validated the programs users wrote based on the input tokens generated from image recognition.
-	Implementation of parts of player movement logic
-	Parts of the game design
-	Testing and bug fixing

The development and evaluation of “Pick2Program” was discussed by our course supervisors in a paper published in the 2020 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON) and is available [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9125087) (subscription required).
A short trailer I cut for internal use can be found [here](https://youtu.be/16qAvqvi_5Q).

Used technology: Android Studio, Java, libGDX 

### QUAD
In my Beachlor’s Thesis, I developed a quiz game for Android-based mobile devices called “QUAD”. It is a Serious Game specifically designed for older adults with Dementia. “QUAD” is designed as a group activity where a game master (e.g., a nursing home caregiver) presents different questions to the audience. Multiple devices can connect to the game master to answer the question based on four possible answers. The game’s concept and design are oriented on popular German TV quiz shows like “Wer wird Millionär?”. Together with questions focusing on topics among nursing home residents, the goal of “QUAD” is to let Dementia patients reminisce and talk about their past experiences to smaller their loneliness, a frequent consequence of Dementia.
The multiplayer component is implemented using [Ubi-Interact]( https://github.com/SandroWeber/ubi-interact), a NodeJS-based plugin for Unity developed by Sandro Weber at TUM. I also participated in fixing some bugs in the plugin I encountered during my development.

The development and theoretical background of “QUAD” can be found in my Bachelor’s Thesis “Development of a Quiz-App for Mobile Devices to use with Dementia Patients”. Further [this video]( https://youtu.be/ph4A03Z5iBM) demonstrated how to use “QUAD”.

Used technology: Unity, C#, Ubi-Interact (NodeJS-based multiplayer plugin for Unity, developed at TUM), Davinci Resolve

### Color Jump 3D
“Color Jump 3D” is a 3D puzzle platformer I developed for the “Introduction to Informatics for Games Engineering” lecture within one day.

You can find demo videos in [this playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLx037SnxNn8nyD2VVBRrMAa-_YPoUhja-&si=zYDj_mj23EPdhrHY).

Used technology: Unity, C#, Davinci Resolve

### Blub’s Adventure
“Blub’s Adventure” (German name: Blubs Abenteuer) is a serious game for preschool children available for Android and Windows. It aims to teach them the connection between number values and their Arabic representation and basic calculations using addition and subtraction. I developed the game with [Maximilian Anzinger](https://github.com/MaximilianAnzinger) for the interdisciplinary project with educational psychology we had to do for our Master’s Degree. The development was supervised by the [research team]( https://www.psy.lmu.de/ffp_en/persons/ag-niklas/index.html) of Prof. Dr. Frank Niklas, professor for Educational Psychology and Family Studies at the University of Munich (LMU).

My tasks in the development of “Blub’s Adventure” were:
-	All gameplay and UI programming
-	Implementation of cutscene videos into Unity
-	Design and implementation of additional help systems
-	Parts of the game design
-	Parts of the level design

A description of the development and theoretical background of “Blub’s Adventure” can be found in the project report “Blub’s Adventure – an Educational Android Application Teaching Numeracy”. A complete gameplay walkthrough can be found in [this playlist]( https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLx037SnxNn8neuPhdR_PWuka9DNtJm4iR). Further, the project files and game build can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/Mauri2070/Blubs-Abenteuer).

Used technology: Unity, C#, Davinci Resolve

### Robody in the Hospital
“Robody in the Hospital” (German name: Robody im Krankenhaus) is a Serious Game I’m developing for my Master’s Thesis. It is an interactive story game introducing the care robot “Robody” and his capabilities in the use case scenario of a hospital.

Further information will be added after the completion of the thesis (eta June 2025).

Used technology: Unity, C#, Blender, Inkscape, Audacity, Davinci Resolve

### Bonusprogram for Nurses (WIP)
The “Hypnosis App” (working title) is a Serious Game I’m developing for my Master’s Thesis. It is a walking simulator teaching self-hypnosis.

Further information will be added after the completion of the thesis (eta June 2025).

Used technology: Unity, C#, Blender, Inkscape, Audacity, Davinci Resolve

### Osteoarthritis App (WIP)
The “Osteoarthritis App” (working title) is a Serious Game I’m developing for my Master’s Thesis. It will teach players about osteoarthritis prevention.

Further information will be added after the completion of the thesis (eta June 2025).

Used technology: Unity, C#, Blender, Inkscape, Audacity, Davinci Resolve

## Private Game Projects
This section describes the private game projects I developed for fun for my family and friends. Sample images can be found in “PrivateProjectsOverview.pdf”.

### PongPong
“PongPong” is a modern clone of the original Pong game for PC. It features gameplay against the AI in four different difficulty levels and local multiplayer. Further, different ball and paddle shapes and colors can be chosen. Additionally, three special modes can be combined: In “Where’s the ball?” the side of the play area with the ball is hidden, so players have to anticipate where the ball will move. “Slow mode” will slow down the gameplay, and “Additional blocker” will add an automatically moving paddle in the middle of the play area. Finally, the game lets the player import their music for background music.

Used technology: Unity, C#

### JumpJump
“JumpJump” is a small 2D game for PC. The twist of the game is the controls. The player can only decide on one direction – left, right, or up – and determine the jump strength by holding a button down. The goal is to navigate through the level and collect as many points as possible, either in a limited time (60 or 120 seconds) or by reaching the goal as fast as possible. Scores are saved in a local scoreboard per category.

Used technology: Unity, C#

### Decorate the Christmas Tree
“Decorate the Christmas Tree” is a 2D game for PC and Android where the player has to move a Christmas tree left and right to collect falling baubles. The game ends when too many baubles hit the ground. The difficulty increases over time when baubles start to spawn and fall faster.

Used technology: Unity, C#, Pixel Studio

### Welder Run
“Welder Run” is a 2D sidescrolling endless runner for PC. The goal is to collect welding tools to gather points while avoiding obstacles.

Used technology: Unity, C#, Pixel Studio
