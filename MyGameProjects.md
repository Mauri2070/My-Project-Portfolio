# My Game Projects

## University Projects

This section describes the games I made during my informatics studies at the Technical University of Munich (TUM).

### Pick2Program

In my bachelor's degree, I participated in the practical course “IT-based learning,” where I developed the Serious Game “Pick2Program” with three others. The game is an Android app that teaches children the basics of computational thinking. Players must find their way through increasingly complex mazes by writing short programs using an intuitive symbol language. The programs are input by taking photos of the symbols.

My tasks in the development of “Pick2Program” were:

* Development of the symbol language
* Implementation of the parser that validated the programs users wrote based on the input tokens generated from image recognition.
* Implementation of parts of the player movement logic
* Parts of the game design
* Testing and bug fixing

The development and evaluation of “Pick2Program” was discussed by our course supervisors in a paper published in the 2020 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON) and is available [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9125087) (subscription required).
A short trailer I cut for internal use can be found [here](https://youtu.be/16qAvqvi_5Q).

Used technology: Android Studio, Java, libGDX

### QUAD

In my Bachelor’s Thesis, I developed a quiz game for Android-based mobile devices called “QUAD”. It is a Serious Game specifically designed for older adults with Dementia. “QUAD” is designed as a group activity where a game master (e.g., a nursing home caregiver) presents different questions to the audience. Multiple devices can connect to the game master to answer the question based on four possible answers. The game’s concept and design are oriented on popular German TV quiz shows like “Wer wird Millionär?”. Using questions focusing on topics among nursing home residents, the goal of “QUAD” is to let Dementia patients reminisce and talk about their past experiences to smaller their loneliness, a frequent consequence of Dementia.

The multiplayer component is implemented using [Ubi-Interact](https://github.com/SandroWeber/ubi-interact), a NodeJS-based plugin for Unity developed by Sandro Weber at TUM. I also participated in fixing some bugs in the plugin I encountered during my development.

The development and theoretical background of “QUAD” can be found in my Bachelor’s Thesis “Development of a Quiz-App for Mobile Devices to use with Dementia Patients”. Further, [this video](https://youtu.be/ph4A03Z5iBM) demonstrated how to use “QUAD”.

Used technology: Unity, C#, Ubi-Interact (NodeJS-based multiplayer plugin for Unity, developed at TUM), Davinci Resolve

### Color Jump 3D

### Blub’s Adventure

“Blub’s Adventure” (German name: Blubs Abenteuer) is a serious game for preschool children available for Android and Windows. It aims to teach them the connection between number values and their Arabic representation, and basic calculations using addition and subtraction. I developed the game with [Maximilian Anzinger](https://github.com/MaximilianAnzinger) for the interdisciplinary project with educational psychology we had to do for our Master’s Degree. The development was supervised by the [research team](https://www.psy.lmu.de/ffp_en/persons/ag-niklas/index.html) of Prof. Dr. Frank Niklas, professor for Educational Psychology and Family Studies at the University of Munich (LMU).

My tasks in the development of “Blub’s Adventure” were:

* All gameplay and UI programming
* Implementation of cutscene videos into Unity
* Design and implementation of additional help systems
* Parts of the game design
* Parts of the level design

A description of the development and theoretical background of “Blub’s Adventure” can be found in the project report “Blub’s Adventure – an Educational Android Application Teaching Numeracy”. A complete gameplay walkthrough can be found in [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLx037SnxNn8neuPhdR_PWuka9DNtJm4iR). Further, the project files and game build can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/Mauri2070/Blubs-Abenteuer).

Used technology: Unity, C#, Davinci Resolve

## How I learned game development: GameDev.tv course projects

This section describes the game projects I completed to learn game development following online courses from [GameDev.tv](https://www.gamedev.tv/). For some projects, I just followed along, for others, I added additional features and levels on my own.

### Jacky Abenteuer (Text101)

I started learning Unity using the “Complete C# Unity 2D Game Developer” course by GameDev.tv. Part of this course was the “Text101” text adventure game. “Jackys Abenteuer” (engl. Jacky’s Adventure) is my version of this game featuring my own, Halloween-themed story. You can play the game on [itch.io](https://mauri2070.itch.io/jackys-abenteuer) (German only!).

Used technologies: Unity, C#

### Glitch Garden

I started learning Unity using the “Complete C# Unity 2D Game Developer” course by GameDev.tv. Part of this course was “Glitch Garden”, a “Plants vs. Zombies”-like tower defense game. You can get an idea of the game in [this video](https://youtu.be/sqAD9AIDnsM).

## Private Game Projects

This section describes the private game projects I developed for fun for my family and friends.

### PongPong

“PongPong” is a modern clone of the original Pong game for PC. It features gameplay against the AI in four different difficulty levels and local multiplayer. Further, different ball and paddle shapes and colors can be chosen. Additionally, three special modes can be combined: In “Where’s the ball?”, the side of the play area with the ball is hidden, so players have to anticipate where the ball will move. “Slow mode” will slow down the gameplay, and “Additional blocker” will add an automatically moving paddle in the middle of the play area. Finally, the game lets the player import their music for background music.

Used technology: Unity, C#

### JumpJump

“JumpJump” is a small 2D platformer game for PC. The twist of the game is the controls. The player can only decide on one direction – left, right, or up – and determine the jump strength by holding down a button. The goal is to navigate through the level and collect as many points as possible, either in a limited time (60 or 120 seconds) or by reaching the goal as fast as possible. Scores are saved in a local scoreboard per category. You can play the game on [itch.io](https://mauri2070.itch.io/jumpjump) (German only!).

Used technology: Unity, C#

### Decorate the Christmas Tree

“Decorate the Christmas Tree” is a 2D game for PC and Android where the player has to move a Christmas tree left and right to collect falling baubles. The game ends when too many baubles hit the ground. The difficulty increases over time when baubles start to spawn and fall faster.

Used technology: Unity, C#, Pixel Studio

### Welder Run

“Schweißer Lauf” (Engl. Welder Run) is a 2D side-scrolling endless runner for PC. The goal is to collect welding tools to gather points while avoiding obstacles. Pixelart was created by me as well. You can play the game on [itch.io](https://mauri2070.itch.io/schweisser-lauf )(German only, but language is not important for this game).
